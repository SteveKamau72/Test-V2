# Test-V2
# Challenge
Add a button labelled "GITHUB"
if the button GitHub is pressed, using the github public api, display a list of current trending GitHub repositories.

# Extras:
1. Used [Glide Image Loading library](https://github.com/bumptech/glide). Glide is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.

2. Implemented [loopj Asynchronous Http Client](http://loopj.com/android-async-http/), an asynchronous callback-based Http client for Android built on top of Apacheâ€™s HttpClient libraries. 

3. Used [ButterKnife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/). A field and method binding for Android views which uses annotation processing to generate boilerplate code for you.
